Artful Portfolio (root)

The Vite app files have been moved to the repository root so you can run the dev server from the project root.

Install & run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you previously installed dependencies inside `frontend/`, consider removing or updating nested `node_modules` and lockfiles to avoid conflicts.
